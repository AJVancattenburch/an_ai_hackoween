## Castle Grimtol

Halloween Hackathon Starter Repo


### How to Use this Secret

Castle Grimtol used to be one of the checkpoints given out at Codeworks. It was a text based adventure game students would build to sharpen their skills with console applications. As time when on, console apps became less of a focus and much like the story this checkpoint was forgotten. Students only ever heard rumors of it.

Anything on this website is up for grabs. It's images, sounds, colors and stories are for you to use. Either literally or as inspiration. Staying close to Grimtol's origin you could build a text based adventure, a game set in the universe. Alternatively branch out and build a project based around one of the characters, or even a character you could imagine living in this world. The baker could use a delivery app for their goods. The Knight might want a dashboard tracking crimes. Whatever the project may be come up with a way to tie it back to Grimtol.


### Requirements
